waxe.angular:

* spinner for loading?
* center correclty messages and close automatically success and info
* Rendering action: we need to add link or something
* We can't logout since we have to much users
=> check in bootstrap to add max-height on elements: we also have probem on modal
* Remove hardcoded API url in apiurl
* The welcome page is not really nice
* Login page is not really nice too
* Review the entire design

waxe.xml:

* Where are the ckeditor js and config ? We have entities in the XML...
